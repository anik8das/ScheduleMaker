# ScheduleMaker
A web app to automatically create a weekly schedule based on the input tasks and committed times.
The tasks are automatically assigned to a slot in the schedule, which is set to be weekly for now, according to prior commitments and preferences.

During this summer, I was working on several goals, such as learning Mandarin and working for my internships. However, to make my schedule organized, I had to manually take tasks and assign it a spot. Since there were a large number of them, this task was tedious. Additionally, removing or adding just one task deeply affected the entire schedule. Thus, I came up with the idea of a "Scheduler" which would automatically assign the tasks based on the prior commitments and preferences.  
This idea was even more encouraging because it presented an opportunity to deep dive into advanced javascript code. Only within a month of this project, I have coded structures for time, tasks, insertion, and removal. However, progress has been significantly slowed because of college starting.  
Regarding the UI, I tried to keep it minimalistic. For the input, I have kept it as user input temporarily for testing but look forward to switching it to a convenient medium such as Google calendars in the future.
